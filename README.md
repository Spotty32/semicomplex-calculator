# semicomplex-calculator
A Console based calculator able to calculate more advanced equations like sin, cos, tan, log, sqrt but also basic ones like -, +, *, /

During my testing no issues were found, If I do find any major issue, I'll update the code with the newer version

This is my first ever commit on GitHub and also my first ever project in C.
